    <p>I hope you like chocolate, because these tarts sure have some! Top with whipped topping. You can also add a slice of strawberry to each tart, but it's not necessary.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup dark corn syrup</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup flaked coconut</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C);</li>
        <li>Mix flour, 3/4 cup butter, and powdered sugar together to form pastry. Press about 1 teaspoon of pastry firmly against the bottoms and sides of 48 ungreased mini muffin cups. Do not extend pastry over the rims. Refrigerate while making the filling;</li>
        <li>Heat chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons butter in a 1-quart saucepan over low heat until melted. Remove from heat; stir in corn syrup and white sugar. Beat in eggs until filling is smooth;</li>
        <li>Fill each tart shell 3/4 full with chocolate filling, about 1 teaspoon. Sprinkle coconut and pecans on top;</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is mostly set and pastry is golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Lift out tarts with the tip of a knife; cool on a wire rack;</li>
    </ol>
